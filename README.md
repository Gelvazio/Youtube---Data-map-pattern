## Data Map Pattern ðŸ—¾

This is the code of my first video on youtube where I explain about Data Map Pattern and the difference 
between Data Map Pattern and MVC Pattern and created a project using Data Map Pattern and another concepts like DTO, SoC and Dependency Inversion. 

## Running

To run the project, you first must have to execute the command:

    yarn
    
or 

    npm install

Then, you can run the project with the command:

    yarn dev:server 
    
or 

    npm dev:server
